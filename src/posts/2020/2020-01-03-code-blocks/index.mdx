>this is quote

MDX lets you write JSX embedded inside markdown, perfect for technical blogs. MDX works with Gatsby through [gatsby-plugin-mdx](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx/). You can learn more about it in the Gatsby docs: [Getting Started with MDX](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/mdx/getting-started/).
