__ACES Portal application__ started as a main project for College of Animal Sciences to efficiently manage the keys and spaces in the building.
Previously, the entire process was done with `paper`, which was extremely inefficient and time-consuming.
The application provided an easy way to make requests and manage all the information in one place for all the users, including key managers, staffs, faculties, and students.

## 1. Tasks

Before the development, the first step was to plan out the key process of putting key or space requests.
To do that, we built a flow chart

### 1.1 Keys

<GatsbyImage alt='Keys flow chart' image={getImage(props.localImages[5])}/>
<Caption fig="x" message="Keys flow chart"/>

<GatsbyImage alt='Aces portal main page' image={getImage(props.localImages[6])}/>
<Caption fig="x" message="Aces portal main page"/>

## Development process

## Key takeaway

## Result



<GatsbyImage alt='Aces portal main page' image={getImage(props.localImages[0])}/>
<Caption fig="x" message="Main page for the ACES Portal"/>

<GatsbyImage alt='Aces portal main page' image={getImage(props.localImages[1])}/>
<Caption fig="x" message="Main page for the ACES Portal"/>

<GatsbyImage alt='Aces portal main page' image={getImage(props.localImages[2])}/>
<Caption fig="x" message="Main page for the ACES Portal"/>

<GatsbyImage alt='Aces portal main page' image={getImage(props.localImages[3])}/>
<Caption fig="x" message="Main page for the ACES Portal"/>
